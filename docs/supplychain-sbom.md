## About this document

* In [Open-Source Software](glossary.md#open-source-software) supply chains, we find people filling distinct roles that each care about some metadata or tasks in SBOMs.
* This document attempts to offer an overview of these roles, how they are related, and what each role cares about.
* The rationale behind this document lays in the document author's perceiving that there were no good sources that described how SBOMs should (or could!) be used throughout an Open Source Software supply-chain.
    * Much of existing documentation focused heavily on SBOMs from the perspective of a software suppliers (businesses) or consumers.
    * Frustration with the lack of a clear Open Source perspective brought the author to the SBOM devroom at FOSDEM 2024 to offer [a rant](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3358-can-sboms-become-first-class-citizens-in-open-source-ecosystems-/) about what he perceived as a less-than-ideal state of affairs.
* This document exists in large part due to the author's attempt at taking notes while figuring out what the state of the art in SBOM.
* Please take this document as it is – a public set of notes, intended as a source for illumination and as an ongoing conversation, taking incremental steps toward more transparent and accountable Open Source supply-chains.

### Purpose TL;DR

In this document we're trying to identify and expose all places and roles in an Open Source supply chain where someone cares about some metadata (and it's associated code) that someone downstream needs for detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities.


## The relation between Supply-chain Roles and SBOM Roles

* Any single person working within a supply-chain may have one or more roles, and switch between them as needed.
* Each supply-chain role described in this document _MAY_ care about some specific SBOM metadata and their accompanying artifacts.
* Each SBOM role described in this document _MUST_ also have a supply-chain role.
* If a supply-chain role cares about some SBOM metadata, they have one or more of the following SBOM roles.
    * When a Supply-chain Role creates or updates an SBOM, we call them an [SBOM Author](glossary#sbom-author--role-).
    * When a Supply-chain Role distributes an SBOM, we call them an [SBOM Distributor](glossary#sbom-distributor--role-).
    * When a Supply-chain Role consumes an SBOM, we call them an [SBOM Consumer](glossary#sbom-consumer--role-)
* SBOM Authors may also be differentiated by the fact that they produce original (authoritative) metadata fields, or just assemble or update existing ones.
    * When an SBOM Role is the authoritative source of some metadata, they are an [SBOM Author](glossary#sbom-author--role-).
    * When an SBOM Role is gathering SBOM metadata from different dependencies, they are an [SBOM Assembler](glossary#sbom-assembler--role---).


## SBOM Roles

It may be useful to distinguish between roles that are focused on the SBOM documents themselves, from roles that are involved in a supply-chain activity.
For further reading, please see CISA's "SBOM Sharing Roles and Considerations" recommendations ([CISA-2024](#references)).

## Color-coding legend for SBOM Roles

The color-coding is used in this document to help illustrate different SBOM activities.

* 🟥 Create, define, sign SBOM metadata — _**SBOM Author** makes sure it and related artifacts **Exist**_.
* 🟨 Assemble, update, annotate SBOM metadata — _**SBOM Assembler** makes sure it and related artifacts are **Current**_.
* 🟩 Distribute, curate, attest, index SBOM metadata — _**SBOM Distributor** makes sure it and related artifacts are made **Available** to others_.
* 🟦 Consume, aggregate, verify SBOM metadata — _**SBOM Consumer** makes sure it and related artifacts are **Complete**, **Correct** or **Compliant**_.


### SBOM Author

> [!NOTE]
> FIXME – Check if this is sane.

* SBOM Authors create, define or sign SBOM metadata — _They make sure the fields and related artifacts **Exist**_. (CPANSec-2024)
    * This mostly means authoritative metadata fields as laid out in the different [Supply-chain Roles](#supply-chain-roles-and-metadata) below.
    * In addition to fields encountered throughout the supply-chain, they care about the fields listed in the table below.
* They may edit SBOM files manually or use tooling for analyzing artifacts, or ideally – use have SBOMs generated automatically as part of a build process. (NTIA-2021, "Produce" category)
* Creates an SBOM. (CISA-2024)
    *  This document assumes that each SBOM created is available for sharing.

### SBOM Assembler

> [!NOTE]
> FIXME – Check if this is sane.

* SBOM Assemblers collect, assemble, update, or annotate SBOM metadata — _They make sure the metadata and related artifacts are **Current**_. (CPANSec-2024)
    * This role is very similar to SBOM Author roles, but while an SBOM Author mainly concerns themselves with the creation of authoritative meta fields, the SBOM Assembler ensures they are complete and correct.
* They may for example collect SBOMs throughout build dependency resolution, and assemble (merge), translate (transform), to produce SBOMs for analysis or audit purposes. (NTIA-2021, "Transform" category, paraphrased)

### SBOM Distributor

> [!NOTE]
> FIXME – Check if this is sane.

* SBOM Distributor roles distribute, curate, or index SBOM metadata — _They make sure the metadata and related artifacts are made **Available** to others_. (CPANSec-2024)
    * They don't have any specific metadata fields that are commonly used across the different supply-chain consumer roles, beyond ensuring that SBOMs are available for others to use and refer to.
* Receives SBOMs for the purpose of sharing them with SBOM Consumers or other Distributors. (CISA-2024)
* Additionally, an SBOM Distributor may care about the following activities. (CISA-2023)
    * Discovery: Mechanism used by the consumer to know the SBOM exists and how to access it.
    * Access: Access control mechanisms used by the author or provider to regulate who can view or use an SBOM.
    * Transport: Mechanism provided by the author or distributor to transfer an SBOM.  Also, the action of the consumer receiving an SBOM.

(Ref: [CISA-2023](#references), [CISA-2024](#references), [CPANSec-2024](#references))


### SBOM Consumer

> [!NOTE]
> FIXME – Check if this is sane.

* SBOM Consumer roles gather, inspect, analyze, aggregate or verify SBOM metadata — _They make sure metadata and related artifacts are **Useful**, **Complete**, **Correct** or **Compliant**_. (CPANSec-2024)
    * They don't have any specific metadata fields that are commonly used across the different supply-chain consumer roles.
* They may view SBOM files to understand the contents, and use this information to support decision making & business processes, or to compare and contrast SBOMs to discover significant changes or vulnerabilities. (NTIA-2021, "Consume" category)
* Receives the transferred SBOM. (CISA-2024)
    * This could include roles such as third parties, authors, integrators, and end users.

#### Supplier

Is a role within an [Integrator Environment](#integrator-environment).
The term is used within the NTIA "SBOM Minimum Elements" document as the legal source of a component.

* See also [Manufacturer](#manufacturer), [Owner](#owner), [Open-Source Software Steward](#open-source-software-steward), [Supplier](glossary.md#supplier) in the glossary.


### Author (SBOM)

See [SBOM Author](#sbom-author)


### Author

Operates within an [Author Environment](#author-environment).
The initial and/or main creator of the component in question.
Typically works on all aspects of the code, including features, bug fixes, tests and security issues.
Has the final say on the original contents of the package.
The Author _can_ be a group of people, though a single point of responsibility is common.
If an Author has upstream (reverse) dependencies, the Author is also considered to be a Developer (as seen from the upstream Author's perspective; See below).
Not to be confused with the [SBOM Author](#sbom-author--role-) role.

#### Contributor

Operates independently, but through a [Public Collaboration Ecosystem](#public-collaboration-ecosystem).
Interacts with component with bug reports, feedback, quality assurance, testing, patches or pull requests.
May or may not have repository commit privileges.
May also have additional roles, including being a downstream [Developer](#developer), [Patcher](#patcher) or [Author](#author).

#### Steward

> [!NOTE]
> Steward has a specific defined meaning in the EU Cyber Resilience Act, so it's better to avoid using the term as a synonym for [Custodian](#custodian).


### Importer

May operate in any ecosystem or environment.
A role specifically used when a EU entity makes available software on the EU market,
Is required to verify that the imported software is compliant with the EU Cyber Resilience Act according to it's Article 19.

### Patcher

Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem).
Applies security and/or bug fixes to packages before building and packaging.
Works mainly with a downstream [Packager](#packager), and has [Author](#author)'s downstream ecosystems as upstream.

This role is necessary when...

* Upstream Author roles are not responsive or available, and thereby security fixes aren't applied there.
* When downstream constraints and requirements call for it – e.g. when back-porting of fixes are needed due to downstream long-term support (LTS) requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> * Patchers (a role that often is held by the same person as the Packager), may select and apply patches before building.
> * These patches may include back-ports of features, security fixes or other accommodations necessary for distributing multiple releases of the same upstream project, but within publishing constraints decided by the Curator of the Ecosystem (e.g. LTS releases, support contracts, etc.).
> * A Packager can both be found in-house (e.g. a business who uses a company-internal package mirror), for a Package Ecosystem provider (e.g. Debian), or a Language Ecosystem provider (e.g. a company-internal CPAN mirror that distributes patched packages).

### Builder

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Builders should add build environment metadata (including resolved dependencies) in an accompanying SBOM file.

* See also [Packager](#packager), [Deployer](#packager).

#### Packager

Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem) or an [Author Environment](#author-environment).
Within a package ecosystem, builds and creates packages from components received from an upstream source, optionally with patches applied from the [Patcher](#patcher).
Within an author environment, creates packages from their own project in preparation for publication in a downstream [Language Ecosystem](#language-ecosystem) (e.g. create a CPAN package for uploading to CPAN using the PAUSE interface).
Concerns themselves with correct package format and structure, and that package metadata is preserved and updated.

> [!NOTE]
> * Packagers take upstream components from an upstream source  and build and install them into a custom environment for producing system packages for their native packaging ecosystem (e.g. APT).
> * Upstream sources may be…
>     * Author's repository, or a Custodian's if a project is dormant (e.g. a repository on Codeberg).
>     * Language-specific packages distributed by a Language Ecosystem (e.g. CPAN).
> * E.g. someone in the #debian-perl group downloads, builds, tests and installs something from CPAN, but instead of doing a regular install, they use tooling like `dh-make-perl` to produce a custom installation directory that can be incorporated into a .deb archive.

#### Deployer

Operates within a [Production Environment](#production-environment).
Final preparation and installation of the software into a CI/CD or other deployment method an [Integrator](#integrator-environment) or [Production Environment](#production-environment).

| Do | Field name                     | Required | Data type    | CycloneDX 1.6                                          | SPDX | Required by           |

### Curator

Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem) or a [Language Ecosystem](#language-ecosystem).
Selects or pins which components are suitable for use downstream of the package ecosystem.
Works mainly with the [Distributor](#distributor) role.
Concerns themselves with both the stability and predictability of components, and how this is prioritized against the need for features, bug fixes and security updates.

> [!NOTE]
> * Curators may decide both whether and where the output of a Packager is distributed.
> * Curators may operate both in-house, in order to keep an eye on what is being automatically installed there, or they may make the decisions that happen on the Package or Language Ecosystem provider side.
> * Typically, a curator may consider LTS status, support contract terms or other reasons for distributing a package.

### Distributor

Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem) or a [Language Ecosystem](#language-ecosystem).
Ensures the availability of packages, that they are indexed correctly, and that any related metadata is up-to-date, correct and available.

> [!NOTE]
> * Distributors take packages that Patchers and Packagers produce, and ensure these are made available in a reliable way for downstream users according to the Curator's requirements. (e.g. by setting up and managing a Debian APT repository, or a CPAN mirror, or similar).
> * If SBOM metadata is expected to accompany the packages in question, the Distributor makes sure this happens.
> * Distributors have additional requirements and considerations laid out in CISA-2024.
> * Distributors have additional requirements around compliance, laid out in the EU Cyber Resilience Act Article 20.

### Developer

Operates within an [Integrator Environment](#integrator-environment).
Uses packages and components as dependencies in their own project, product or component.
A Developer is in many ways identical to an [Author](#author) from the upstream Author's perspective, with the main difference being that a Developer doesn't publish their work as [Open-Source Software](glossary.md#open-source-software).
A Developer that publishes their software as [Open-Source Software](glossary.md#open-source-software), is called an [Author](#author).

## Commentary and FIXME points (FIXME: remove when done)

1. Open Source in CRA... Author -> Provider -> Supplier -> Steward -> Manufacturer -> Distributor -> Importer
2. Open Source in CRA (simplified)... Hobbyist -> Author -> Author w/Steward -> Manufacturer
3. Add graph/description on build steps, to illustrate how different SBOM files may be found, sourced, generated, assembled, installed and shared for later verification or analysis.
4. Clearer distinction between "Author", "SBOM Author", "Developer", and "Integrator". Should "Author" strictly be about SBOM production, and an Open Source Developer be called a "Developer"? In that case, someone who doesn't publish as Open Source, would have to be called "Integrator". Is that OK?
5. Possible inclusion of "Config Ecosystems" or "Data Ecosystems" to take into account vulnerabilities/malware found in plugins, AI models or other shared data.
6. Enumerate what distinguishes the different environments
    * Language: Not built, not deployed, Is source code, No execution environment
    * Distro/package: Built, Deployed, Is object, No execution environment
    * Model/plugin: Built, Not deployed, Is data, No execution environment (FIXME: unsure)
    * Image/container: Built, Deployed, Is object, Has execution environment
7. Enumerate the different dependency types; Author/develop, configure, build, test, runtime, resolved, required/unresolved, embedded, post-deploy (plugin/dynamic), cross-ecosystem vs. in-ecosystem, up-river vs. down-river, upstream vs. downstream, reverse, assumed/implied vs. stated/explicit, patch deps, system deps, environment deps, ecosystem deps
